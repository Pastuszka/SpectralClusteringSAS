/* spccEigenLSym: Compute eigenvectors of the normalized LSym laplacian.
   Input:
   Required:
   m         a neighborhood matrix
   nvecs     number of eigenvectors to return. It is recommended to use one less
             vector than clusters searched. Note that in case of a complete 
             neighborhood matrix the first eigenvector will be constant and convey
			 no information. In that situation use one more eigenvector.
